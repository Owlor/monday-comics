# Canonball

Canonball is a game inspired by crossover fiction and by team sports like basketball. Characters go on hero's journeys to get an Elixir and bring it back home to score a goal.

Canonball is like a very simple miniatures game or TCG. However, there is no measurement of distance between pieces, and the pieces are almost never face down and shuffled. It's simpler than that. Read on for the description.

(TODO: Now that this game has been designed, try it out. Playtest it!)

## Card pool design

There are two types of cards: Character cards and evidence cards.

Characters have just two stats: Cleverness and Brawn, each between 2 and 6, inclusive. (These limits make it possible for any three characters to team up against any one character.)

To make it possible to play the game, here are four cards:

* Flag - Evidence - The character who knows me gets +2 Brawn if they're my ally ("knowing what they're fighting for") and +2 Cleverness otherwise ("blackmail").

* Alice - Character (C2 B2) - Upon starting the game, pick a number between 2 and 6, inclusive, at random. This character's Cleverness becomes that number. Do the same for Brawn.

* Bob - (same as Alice)

* Carol - (same as Alice)

## Deckbuilding

A player comes to the game having chosen three distinct character cards and an evidence card.

## Playing the game

Players review the characters and evidence cards of their opponents' decks. They arrange their own cards face down. They assign one to hold a ball and one to hold evidence. Then all players reveal their characters at the same time.

Play proceeds through a series of 10 turns.

After that, whichever player has scored the most goals is the winner. The game may end in a draw.

### Taking a turn

On each turn, all players privately write down the moves each of their characters will make, and then they reveal all the moves at once. The various kinds of moves are carried out in a series of steps. Multiple moves in the same step are carried out simultaneously.

#### Permitted moves, organized by step:

* (Step 1) If a player's ball has left play for any reason, exactly one of the characters controlled by that player must pick it up.

* (Step 2) A character (with helpers) can make a Cleverness check against another character (with helpers) in the hopes of changing the second character's controller to a chosen player until end of turn. On success, that change occurs. This is known as persuasion. In the case of a chain of persuasion (e.g. where character A persuades character B to persuade character C), first process moves by characters who are already controlled by the person who specified the move. Repeat this process until all the remaining moves of this kind, if any, were specified by players other than the characters' respective controllers.

* (Step 3) Two characters can coordinate to pass a ball between them.

* (Step 4) A character (with helpers) can make a Brawn check against another character (with helpers) who holds a ball. On success, they can take that ball.

* (Step 4) A character can give a copy of evidence they hold to another character who doesn't have equivalent evidence.

* (Step 4) A character can destroy a single piece of evidence they hold.

* (Step 4) If a character doesn't already have a chosen player's evidence, and if that player is the character's controller, then that character (with helpers) can make a Cleverness check of 6. On success, they conjure a copy of that player's evidence.

* (Step 5) If a character holds an opponent's ball, that character (with helpers) can make a Brawn check of 6. On success, their controller scores a goal, and the ball leaves play.

### Making Cleverness and Brawn checks

To make a Cleverness or Brawn check, simply total the stats of the characters involved on each side and make a comparison. In the case of a tie, flip a coin.

Some checks specify a specific stat total to meet, rather than pitting one group of characters against another.

### Characters helping each other

When making a move that accepts helpers, players privately select helpers among characters they control, and then they reveal those choices simultaneously.

A character may not help themselves.

A character may not help a character if they've already helped a different character in the time since the moment the turn started or the moment the first character most recently changed control, whichever came last.

A character may not help if a move has been chosen for them this turn. This is true even if they can no longer carry out that move for any reason.
